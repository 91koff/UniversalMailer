{"name":"Universal Mailer","tagline":"Universal Mailer, the missing plugin for Mail.app","body":"## What is Universal Mailer?\r\nUniversal Mailer is a Mail.app plugin that solves some issues when sending emails. It removes ATT00001.htm files, it correctly formats messages with attachments and inline images and offers an option to set the default font for outgoing messages.\r\n\r\nWhen enabled, Universal Mailer is able to correctly format outgoing emails, so that even after Exchange EWS filtering they retain the original format.\r\n\r\nThe plugin runs in the background without interfering with your work: all you have to do is set a default font for outgoing emails and write your emails as usual. When you hit the Send button Universal Mailer checks the email for you and modifies it as needed.\r\n\r\n## Do I need it?\r\nUniversal Mailer will be useful if any of these sound familiar to you:\r\n\r\nYour sent email contains unwanted ATT00001.htm attachments that prevent some email clients from viewing the complete text\r\nYou are used to alternate text and images inside your emails but your recipients can't see them as intended\r\nYour sent emails are hard to read because they are displayed with a small font by some email clients\r\nLatest versions\r\nUniversal Mailer is open source software. This means that you can grab the entire source code and modify it as you wish.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to contribute to the project you can either make patches/additions to the source code or make an open donation using this link:\r\n\r\n[Donate](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=5J2D75Z629L66)\r\n \r\n## Download\r\nIf you don't want to grab the source code and compile yourself the plugin, here is the latest version of it.
