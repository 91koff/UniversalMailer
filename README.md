UniversalMailer 2.0
===================

<h3><a href='http://universalmailer.github.io/UniversalMailer/'>Universal Mailer homepage</a></h3>

Universal Mailer is a plugin for Mail.app that aims at setting a default font for outgoing emails and fixing issues
with some clients (i.e. MS Exchange/Outlook) about layout. It also removes those unwanted ATT0001 files from your
emails.

This new 2.0 version of the plugin is meant to be used on OS X 10.9 and is _not_ backward compatible.
Download version 1.x from <a href='http://universalmailer.github.io/UniversalMailer/download.html'>here</a> if
you are on an older version of OS X.

<h2>Do I need it?</h2>
Universal Mailer will make your day if any of these sound familiar to you:
* Your sent email contains unwanted ATT00001.htm or ATT0001.txt attachments
* Your sent email can't be read as a whole, it is split in several ATT000x files
* You inline images in your emails but your recipients can't see them as you expected
* You want your email to have a specific font but are tired of selecting all the text and choosing a font
* Your sent emails are hard to read because they are displayed with a too small font on some email clients

If that describes your frustrations, give Universal Mailer a try and see if it can simplify your workflow!
