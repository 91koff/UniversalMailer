Universal Mailer plugin for Mail.app

Universal Mailer is a Mail.app plugin that solves some issues when sending emails. It removes ATT00001.htm files,
   it correctly formats messages with attachments and inline images and offers an option to set the default font for outgoing messages.
   </p>
   <p>
   When enabled, Universal Mailer is able to correctly format outgoing emails, so that even after Exchange EWS
   filtering they retain the original format.
   </p>
   <p>
   The plugin runs in the background without interfering with your work: all you have to do is set a default font for outgoing emails and
   write your emails as usual. When you hit the Send button Universal Mailer checks the email for you and modifies it as needed.
   </p>

   <h3>Do I need it?</h3>
   <p>Universal Mailer will be useful if any of these sound familiar to you:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Your sent email contains unwanted ATT00001.htm attachments that prevent some email clients from viewing the complete text</li>
    <li>You are used to alternate text and images inside your emails but your recipients can't see them as intended</li>
    <li>Your sent emails are hard to read because they are displayed with a small font by some email clients</li>
   </ul>

<h3>FAQ</h3>
   <p>When using the plugin you may encounter situations where it simply doesn't work. Below are a few common questions that may
   help you if you're in trouble.</p>

   <h4>Q: After I installed the plugin nothing happens. The plugin is not working</h4>
   <p>A: Check if you have other Mail.app plugins installed. Similar plugins may interfere with Universal Mailer and vice-versa. Consider removing
   all of them and keeping only the one you're using.</p>

   <h4>Q: I installed the plugin and I think it loads correctly. Why doesn't it do what it should?</h4>
   <p>A: Check if your Mail.app's settings match those listed on 'Installation &amp; Usage' section. Also, always include an HTML signature,
   as plain text email are _not_ checked by Universal Mailer.</p>

   <h4>Q: Now that I can change the font, what is the suggested size for a 'readable' email?</h4>
   <p>A: It largely depends on personal preference and what you mean by 'readable', however you could start with Helvetica 14pts.
   This is one of the standard fonts, the one you see by default in Mail.app.</p>

   <h4>Q: When I send an email the signature doesn't match Universal Mailer default font</h4>
   <p>A: Signatures (as well as other formatted texts) usually comes with a custom font or a custom size. Universal Mailer can't touch it, because
    it is outside its purposes. Doing so could prevent you to send email with different fonts and sizes.</p>

   <h4>Q: I updated OS X to the latest 10.X.Y version and the plugin has been disabled by Mail.app. What now?</h4>
   <p>A: Due to Apple's restrictions on Mail.app plugins this is a problem you have to live with. After an upgrade of the OS, Apple disables
    all third party's plugins, including Universal Mailer. You need a new version of the plugin to make it work again, it will be posted on the
    download page as soon as it is ready. Starting from version 1.4 you don't need to wait for a new version: just install it again and the
    plugin will be enabled again.</p>

   <h4>Q: I'm trying to install the plugin on Mountain Lion but the system tells me the software comes from an unidentified developer</h4>
   <p>A: This software is not signed, so you have to force the system to load it, in case it refuses to launch it. To temporary change the security policy and install the plugin go to System Preferences, select 'Security &amp; Privacy' and set 'Allow applications downloaded from' to 'Anywhere'. You can then launch the installer and once it completes switch back to your previous setting (Mac App Store or Mac App Store and identified developers).</p>
