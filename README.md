Universal Mailer plugin for Mail.app

Universal Mailer is a Mail.app plugin that solves some issues when sending emails. It removes ATT00001.htm files,
   it correctly formats messages with attachments and inline images and offers an option to set the default font for outgoing messages.
   </p>
   <p>
   When enabled, Universal Mailer is able to correctly format outgoing emails, so that even after Exchange EWS
   filtering they retain the original format.
   </p>
   <p>
   The plugin runs in the background without interfering with your work: all you have to do is set a default font for outgoing emails and
   write your emails as usual. When you hit the Send button Universal Mailer checks the email for you and modifies it as needed.

   <h3>Do I need it?</h3>
   <p>Universal Mailer will be useful if any of these sound familiar to you:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Your sent email contains unwanted ATT00001.htm attachments that prevent some email clients from viewing the complete text</li>
    <li>You are used to alternate text and images inside your emails but your recipients can't see them as intended</li>
    <li>Your sent emails are hard to read because they are displayed with a small font by some email clients</li>
